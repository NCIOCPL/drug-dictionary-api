Red tomato juice contains higher levels of the trans-isomer of lycopene (trans-LYC) compared to the cis-isomer (cis-LYC). Lycopene, a linear, unsaturated hydrocarbon carotenoid, is the major red pigment in certain fruits such as tomatoes, pink grapefruit, apricots, red oranges, watermelon, rosehips, and guava. As an antioxidant, lycopene scavenges free radicals which may both inhibit cellular oxidation and prevent free radical damage to cells. cis-LYC is better absorbed than its trans form.",
