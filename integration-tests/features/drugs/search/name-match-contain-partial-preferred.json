Upon subcutaneous administration of the brachyury-expressing modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-TRICOM vaccine, the expressed brachyury protein induces specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses against brachyury-expressing tumor cells. This causes both tumor cell lysis and a decrease in the growth of brachyury-expressing tumor cells. Brachyury, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that is overexpressed in numerous cancer cell types, is correlated with increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer resistance and cancer progression. TRICOM, a triad of three human T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, B7.1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3, enhances antigen-specific T-cell activation.

Once inside the cell, the virus replicates, resulting in tumor cell lysis and the release of mature viral particles into the tumor microenvironment. Released viral particles may then infect and destroy neighboring tumor cells. In addition, the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by lysed tumor cells into the bloodstream may activate the immune system to mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against  the tumor.
