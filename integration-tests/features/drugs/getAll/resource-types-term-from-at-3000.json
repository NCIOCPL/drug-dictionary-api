As hepcidin plays a key role in the homeostasis of systemic iron, PTG-300 may serve to normalize iron levels. Low levels of endogenous hepcidin are associated with iron overload secondary to excessive absorption of iron as seen in beta thalassemia and paradoxically with iron deficiency anemia.",

In addition, IMU-131 induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HER2-expressing tumor cells.
