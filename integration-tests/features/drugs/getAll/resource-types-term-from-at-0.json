Upon administration, the RGD moiety of 18F-labeled mini-PEG spacered RGD dimer (18F-FPRGD2) binds to alphaVbeta3 integrin. Upon PET, alphaVbeta3-expressing tumor cells can be visualized and the degree of tumor angiogenesis can be determined. This agent exhibits increased integrin receptor binding affinity, tumor cell uptake and increased radiolabeling yield as compared to the non-pegylated form (18F-FRGD2). Integrins, transmembrane glycoproteins, may be upregulated on proliferating tumor vessel endothelial cells and various cancer cells; their overexpression has been associated with neovascularization, differentiation, proliferation of tumor cells, metastasis and an overall poor prognosis."

The fruit also contains high amounts of the flavone velutin which exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. Velutin is able to inhibit the degradation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), thereby blocking the activation of NF-kB, as well as inhibiting phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and JNK. Inhibition of these processes results in suppression of the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6.",

PSMA, a type II membrane protein expressed in all types of prostatic tissues, is often overexpressed in tumor cells. \n",

MILs are harvested from autologous bone marrow from multiple myeloma patients and, in vitro, are exposed to and activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to super-paramagnetic microbeads. After removal of the beads and expansion of the cells in culture, the activated MILs (aMILs) are re-introduced into the patient. The aMILs possess enhanced myeloma specificity, and are able to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment and initiate tumor cell lysis. CD3 and CD28, co-stimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes, play a key role in the activation of T-cells.",
