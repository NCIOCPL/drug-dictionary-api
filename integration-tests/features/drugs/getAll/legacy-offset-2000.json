Upon transfusion, CD33-specific CAR retroviral vector-transduced autologous T lymphocytes target CD33-expressing tumor cells and induce selective toxicity in CD33-expressing tumor cells. Following binding to CD33, the 4-1BB co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances both activation and signaling. Inclusion of the 4-1BB signaling domain may also increase the antitumor activity when compared to the inclusion of the CD3-zeta chain alone. CD33 is expressed on normal non-pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells as well as on myeloid leukemia cells.",

Donor T cell therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation may result in a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) and help control transplant-related viral infections. In the event that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) develops due to donor lymphocyte infusion, CD34/TK75-transduced donor lymphocytes may be selectively eliminated by administration of the prodrug antiviral agent ganciclovir GCV.  In CD34/T75-transduced donor lymphocytes, GCV is phosphorylated by expressed HSV-TK75 to its monophosphate form and, subsequently, converted into its active triphosphate form, which specifically kills the donor lymphocytes.  The expressed CD34 moiety of the chimeric suicide gene serves as a selection marker; mutant 75 of HSV-TK confers increased GCV sensitivity.",
