                "text": "An orally available, lipophilic, organogold compound, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, with anti-inflammatory and potential antineoplastic activities. Auranofin interacts with selenocysteine residue within the redox-active  domain of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thereby blocking the  activity of TrxR. As a result, this agent induces mitochondrial oxidative stress leading to the induction of apoptosis.

Upon intravenous infusion, the autologous anti-PSCA-CAR-4-1BB/TCRzeta-CD19t-expressing T lymphocytes recognize and induce selective toxicity in PSCA-expressing tumor cells. PSCA, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface antigen, is uniquely and highly expressed in certain cancers including bladder, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Co-expression of CD19t provides an inert, non-immunogenic surface marker that allows for measurement of genetically modified cells and tracking of T cells following adoptive transfer. The costimulatory signaling domains improve T-cell function, selectivity, expansion and survival.",
