Although the mechanism of action is unclear, fluorine F 18 acetate preferentially accumulates in tumor tissue, serving as a tracer for imaging tumors with PET. Fluorine 18 has a longer radioactive half-life (110 min) vs. the half-life of carbon-11 acetate (20.4 min). Furthermore, (18)F-FAC showed a rapid clearance from liver and extensive excretion to bile and urine in comparison with carbon-11 acetate, therefore this tracer may be a useful alternative to C-11 acetate for the detection of prostate tumors by PET.",

Upon PET, alphaVbeta3-expressing tumor cells can be visualized and the degree of tumor angiogenesis can be determined. This agent exhibits increased integrin receptor binding affinity, tumor cell uptake and increased radiolabeling yield as compared to the non-pegylated form (18F-FRGD2). Integrins, transmembrane glycoproteins, may be upregulated on proliferating tumor vessel endothelial cells and various cancer cells; their overexpression has been associated with neovascularization, differentiation, proliferation of tumor cells, metastasis and an overall poor prognosis.",
