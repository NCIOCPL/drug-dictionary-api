        "html": "A Fc optimized monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7 homolog 1; B7H1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, durvalumab binds to PD-L1, thereby blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T cells. This may reverse T-cell inactivation and activate the immune system to exert a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1, a member of the B7 protein superfamily, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. The Fc region of durvalumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n",
